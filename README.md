develop skills with pointers further by exploring the use of inheritance  and virtual functions by creatting a 2D array of pointers to recreate Forrest Gumpâ€™s famous box of  chocolates. The program will replicate the concept of grabbing a full box of chocolates 
and selecting randomly and removing, or eating, one chocolate at a time.
